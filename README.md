## üí¨ Problem Statement <a name="problem_statement"></a>

The challenge is to build a resume builder application named Resume Craftr that allows users to create a resume by dynamically allowing sections to be popullated with data.

## üßê Solution summary <a name="solution"></a>

The Resume Craftr is a resume builder application developed using React, React Router DOM, and Redux Toolkit. It allows users to create personalized resumes by dynamically populating sections with relevant data.

Key Features:

- Dynamic Section Creation: Users can dynamically create sections for different parts of their resume, such as personal details, education, work experience, skills, and more. This flexibility allows users to customize their resumes according to their specific requirements.

- Form-Based Data Input: The application provides intuitive forms for users to input their personal information, education details, work experience, skills, and other relevant data. The forms are designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user experience.

- Data Management with Redux Toolkit: Redux Toolkit is utilized for efficient state management, ensuring that resume data is stored centrally and synchronized across different components. This enables seamless data flow and makes it easier to manage complex forms and dynamic sections.

- Navigation with React Router DOM: React Router DOM is integrated into the application to provide smooth navigation between different resume sections. Users can easily switch between personal details, education, work experience, and other sections, making the resume-building process more intuitive and streamlined.

By combining the power of React, React Router DOM, and Redux Toolkit, the Resume Craftr application offers users a seamless and interactive experience for building personalized resumes. Its dynamic section creation, form-based data input, real-time preview, and efficient data management make it a valuable tool for individuals looking to create professional and tailored resumes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
